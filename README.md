# big-sur-automator is currently in test. We'll initialize the project soon.

NOTE: I OWN NONE OF THE TOOLS AND STUFF THAT THIS AUTOMATOR USES. I DIDN'T MAKE THIS FOR PERSONAL GAINS. INFACT I MADE THIS FOR MAKE PATCHING MUCH EASIER FOR USERS. I'LL TAKE THIS REPOSITORY DOWN IF THE TOOL OWNER REQUESTS.
